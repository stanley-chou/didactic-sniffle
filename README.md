#N.B this name is used only so that people don't find it by searching for it on the web and use our work later, the only way they find this is by knowing that this randomly named repo is actually our robotics SF2 final project

by Sunny Chen, Anis Chihoub, and Stanley Chou

This Repository holds the files important for running the models and code of our Street Fighter 2 Reinforcement Learning Model which was written for 
Rutgers ECE 472 Robotics as our final project

The Files:

Robotics_Final_Project_DQN: The Jupyter Notebook file that holds the code for our implementation of reinforcement learning on Streetfighter
using a DQN. The bottom of the file also includes demos and videos of the model playing the game as well as some commentary on it.

Robotics_Final_Project_PPO: The Jupyter Notebook file that holds the code for our implementation of reinforcement learning on Streetfighter
using a PPO.

Robotics_Final_Project_Run: The Jupyter Notebook file that holds the code for running and rendering how a chosen model plays the game on your personal computer

ModelRank1RewardV2...: Folder that holds the first version of the first of the two PPO models we trained and the best version. You can run these files
from any of the other notebooks to continue training, or to play and watch the agent fight through street fighter

ModelRank2RewardV2...: Folder that holds the first version of second of the two PPO models we trained and the best version. You can run these files
from any of the other notebooks to continue training, or to play and watch the agent fight through street fighter

Robotics_Final_Porject_Written_Report: The PDF of our written report for our final project

Robotics_Final_Porject_Video_Slides: The PDF of the slides we used in our video presentation
